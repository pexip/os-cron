Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as 
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do some basic daily system
 maintenance tasks. Other packages, such as checksecurity, can provide further
 maintenance tasks.
